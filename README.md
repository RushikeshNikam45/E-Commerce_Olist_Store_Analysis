## **INTRODUCTION**
In April, I took part in a data challenge hosted by the Twitter data community. The challenge focused on analyzing a dataset from Olist, a well-known e-commerce company in Brazil. This dataset provided crucial details about various aspects of Olist's operations, such as product listings, sellers, and customer interactions. My objective was to explore the dataset and discover valuable insights based on specific questions. The challenge organizers meticulously curated and prepared the dataset to ensure that participants, including myself, could extract meaningful information and gain insights relevant to Olist's business.


## **THE GOALS OF THIS CHALLENEGE**
### This project challenge seeks to achieve the following goalsÂ :
- Validate and clean the data to improve accuracy and usability
- Analyze the data to address the problem statement
- Offer recommendations to Olist company

## **DATASET AND DATA DICTIONARY**
The Olist [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1re0HnJD5TCNVkVDHoPQ08aByKMWRRRJC) comprises nine separate datasets, all of which are stored in CSV format:
1. olist_order_items_dataset
2. olist_orders_dataset
3. olist_order_payments_dataset
4. olist_order_reviews_dataset
5. olist_products_dataset
6. olist_customers_dataset
7. olist_sellers_dataset
8. olist_geolocation_dataset
9. olist_category_dataset

The olist [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/tolamoye/Olist-E-commerce-Data-Aanalysis/files/11643097/Olist.Data.Dictionary.2.pdf) that offers a complete overview of the dataset. This data dictionary is a valuable reference as it provides in-depth explanations of each variable and its significance within the dataset. It serves as a useful tool for understanding and interpreting the data effectively.

## **CLEANING OF ALL THE TABLES**

With the messy table on the left-hand side and the cleaned table on the right-hand side, the cleaning process involved various steps to ensure the data was accurate and consistent. In the messy table, you could see inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and other issues that could potentially impact the analysis. However, after applying rigorous data cleaning techniques, the cleaned table now presents a more organized and reliable dataset. The cleaning process involved handling missing values by imputing or removing them, standardizing formats, correcting inconsistencies, removing duplicates, and addressing any other data quality issues. As a result, the cleaned table provides a solid foundation for conducting meaningful analysis and extracting valuable insights from the dataset.
